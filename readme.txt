This repository is intended to house the code for STIMple Solutions Wearable FES
Course      : Senior Design
Institution : Colorado School of Mines
Term	    : Fall 2018 - Spring 2019

In conjunction with : Craig Hospital

Project Definition : To create a wearable, programmable FES device for use by physical therapists in treatment of
                     patients suffering from traumatic brain injury or spinal cord injury. 

Notes : 
The microcontroller currently being planned to use is the ESP32 Feather by Adafruit. It is compatible with the
